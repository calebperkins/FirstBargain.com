  %h3 PURCHASING AND PAYING FOR BID CREDITS
  %p Bid Credits ("Bid Credits"), are purchased by you prior to bidding. Bid Credits can be purchased in bundles at prices that will be noted on the site. Payment can be made by credit card, debit card or via PayPal. IMPORTANT! BID CREDITS ARE VALID FOR ONE YEAR AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CREDITED TO YOUR ACCOUNT. UPON EXPIRATION, BID CREDITS BECOME VOID AND CAN NO LONGER BE PLACED. Once a Bid Credit is used, it is deducted from your account and can no longer be used. Refunds will not be issued for used Bid Credits, expired Bid Credits or free Bid Credits. For further information on refunds please see our Refund Policy.
.unit
  %h3 MEMBER POINTS
  %p At the time of Bid Credit purchase, FirstBargain.com will deliver MemberPoints ("MemberPoints", "MemberPoint", "Member Points", "Member Point") in amount equal to the dollar value of the purchased Bid Credits. MemberPoints can be used in the Members Shop ("Members Shop") to purchase items at a discount level determined solely by FirstBargain.com. MemberPoints are granted for only Bid Credits purchased through our Bid Pack Store, and expire after 365 days from the date of purchase. Bid Credits won from auctions or from auction "Buy Now" are not eligible for MemberPoints.
  %p MemberPoints are not redeemable for cash and have no cash value. If your account is closed or the Members Shop is cancelled, for any reason, all MemberPoints not yet redeemed are forfeited. MemberPoints forfeited as a result of account or Members Shop closure or violation of these Terms are the sole property of FirstBargain.com.
.unit
  %h3 HOW FirstBargain.com WORKS
  %p With each Bid Credit placed the price of the item on which you are bidding increases by the amount specified. Each new Bid Credit adds time to the auction in an amount equal to the displayed time increment. The auction ends when the auction clock reaches zero. The final bidder is declared the winner. Disputes over auction winners will be decided based on the records maintained by FirstBargain.com. Decisions made by FirstBargain.com in these instances shall be final and binding. Auctions may offer the "Buy Now" option. "Buy Now" will allow you to buy the item bid upon for a price equal to the FirstBargain.com retail value less the value of any Bid Credits used by you during the auction. The option to "Buy Now" will be offered for a limited period of time (usually 24 hours after the auction ends) after which the option to "Buy Now" is revoked.
.unit
  %h3 WINNING THE AUCTION/PAYMENT FOR "BUY NOW"
  %p After an auction has ended, the successful bidder will be presented with a website page that will allow for the auction win to be confirmed, and payment and shipping information to be entered. Auction winners will have 7 days to submit the information on this page and make the payment due. After this 7 day period has elapsed, the ability to claim the item won at auction will be revoked. Similarly, users who choose to "Buy Now" will be presented with a website page that will allow the user to confirm the desire to "Buy Now", enter payment and shipping information and checkout. Users have up to 24 hours after the close of an auction to use the "Buy Now" feature. You may win up to #{Rails.configuration.monthly_win_limit} auctions in a calendar month or #{Rails.configuration.daily_win_limit} times a day, whichever is fewer. Only 1 win of the same product with a retail value over $200 is allowed per calendar month.
.unit
  %h3 MEMBERS SHOP
  %p From time to time, FirstBargain.com may offer items for sale in the Members Shop ("Members Shop, Member Shop"). Usage of the Member Shop is limited to FirstBargain.com users that have purchased Bid Credits and have been awarded Member Points. Users using the Member Shop will be given the opportunity to buy items at a discount using their Member Points. Purchases made in the Member Shop will be completed in an identical manner to those made via the "Buy Now" feature.
.unit
  %h3 RETURNS 
  %p You have the right to return items purchased following a winning auction or "Buy Now" purchase. Users have 14 days after delivery to return an item. You are responsible for shipping costs on returned items and items returned must be in good condition. Requests for returns or cancellations must be made in writing via our #{ link_to "Contact Us", contact_path } form:
  %p If, for any reason, you are unable to return the item in good, working condition, FirstBargain.com will retain the right to accept the returned item and reduce the amount of your refund in a proportion equal to the damage on the item (as determined by FirstBargain.com in its sole discretion). In no case will the return of an item entitle you to a refund of the Bid Credits used to win or purchase the item.

  %h3 COLLUSION/TEAM PLAY
  %p Any kind of collusion or team play is strictly forbidden on FirstBargain. By definition, this includes, but is not limited to, two or more members working together as a team, or creating the impression that there are more people involved and competing to win an auction than there actually are, or placing bids until "Buy Now" offers are earned and then switching over to another account to continue to earn further "Buy Now" offers on the same deal. FirstBargain does not allow two members that know each other to participate in the same auction. Two members participating in the auction are by definition engaging in team play, and automatically lose their right to purchase the product or receive any of their spent Credits back. FirstBargain reserves the right to disqualify in its absolute discretion any users they suspect to be working in a team by voiding all their wins and freezing their accounts. No funds, Credits or bids will be returned or transferred into other accounts.
.unit
  %h3 SYSTEM OUTAGES
  %p At present, and with current technology it is not possible to operate with 100% guaranteed uptime. In some cases, system outages may interrupt the ability to view or bid upon auctions. In this case, FirstBargain.com will halt all auctions and bidding on those auctions until the system outage is resolved. Auctions that are halted will be clearly designated as such. FirstBargain.com will make commercially reasonable efforts to resume the auctions after the outage is resolved. In the event of a system wide outage that prevents you from bidding, FirstBargain.com will refund Bid Credits used in auctions that you were participating in at the time of the auction.
